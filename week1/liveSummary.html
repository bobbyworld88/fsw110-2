        Document Object Model is an interface on most web broswers that displays allows a developer to manipulate, structure and/or style your web page in real time. The DOM is displayed in a web browser in a representional tree view. Can be used to debug a website. You can make sure your code is debugged with the DOM. One way to do this is by using the cosole tab in the web browser inspector to check for errors and modify code on the spot. If you ever want an object to have animation you want to do the following: create a container and within that container create an object with an id. On your CSS stylesheet, set the container position to relative and the object within the conatiner position would be absolute.
